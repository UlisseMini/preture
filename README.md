# preture

Do you hate frameworks? do you hate NPM? you still want some of that SPA goodness on your site?

**BOY TO I HAVE THE PRODUCT FOR YOU**

preture is easy to install (add it to `<head>` in html)
```html
<head>
  <script src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UlisseMini/preture/master/preture.js" defer></script>
</head>
```

preture gets all `<a>` tags on your site which point to other pages on your site, and
prefetches them, then when a link is clicked js handles the transition instantly.

The implementation is quite flakey, Please report bugs in issues :)
